## Solution:

We got the folder as an attachment so I openend it in github desktop. After I opened it, I checked the history of branches and got this.

In branch 3 history, I got the 1st and 4th part of the flag.

In master branch, I found this image and got the 3rd part of the flag

On searching in branch 2 history I found index.html file, which contained the 2nd part of the flag

So combining all these clues (index values) I got the flag

```
string[0] = G
string[1] = 1 
string[2] = t
string[3: 6] = G1g
string[6:9] = ger
string[9] = _
string[10] = 2
string[11] = 7
string[12] = 2
string[13] = 7
```
