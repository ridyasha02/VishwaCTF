# We Are Valorant 
`Difficulty: Easy`

**DESCRIPTION**<br>
One day, while playing Valorant, I received a mail from Riot Games that read,

“In a world full of light, sometimes the shadows help you win.” “Your Signature move also helps you a lot ; develop one and ace it now.”

It also had an image and a video/gif attached to it. I am not able to understand what they want to say. Help me find what the message wants to express.
